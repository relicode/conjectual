# conjectual

## Overview

The idea of this miniproject was to try out [TypeScript Template Literal Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html). It now conjugates Spanish regular verbs. I am not 100% sure of the usefulness of this, but it was worth doing since:
- Spanish is fun but complicated
- TypeScript is fun but complicated

The UI is implemented with Vadim Demedes' excellent [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) library.
