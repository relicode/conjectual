# conjectual

The idea of this miniproject was to mess around with [TypeScript Template Literal Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html). It now conjugates Spanish regular verbs. I am not 100% sure of the usefulness of this, but it was worth doing since:
- Spanish is fun but complicated
- TypeScript is fun but complicated
